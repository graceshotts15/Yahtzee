          The Rules of Yahtzee

      </h1>
 
    <p>There are 5 dice in a yahtzee game, and 13 (or 14) different options to be filled in on your score card.
        You are able to roll the dice at most of 3 times per turn. You want to fill in the score card with everything except 0's as your points.
        You are allowed to enter a 0 anywhere, but you aren't able to change it afterwards. The goal is to complete the score card. Each spot has a different way to get those points.
        In the list below, it will show each way to get the points for that certain option on the score card.
